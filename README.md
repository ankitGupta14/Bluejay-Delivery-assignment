This code is written in Python and utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation. The code is designed to analyze a timecard dataset, specifically an Excel file named 'Assignment_Timecard.xlsx.' The timecard data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame (df), and several operations are performed to extract meaningful information about employee work shifts.

Let's go through each part of the code:
1.Data Loading:
data = pd.read_excel('Assignment_Timecard.xlsx')
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
It reads the timecard data from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame named df. The DataFrame is a tabular data structure that allows for easy manipulation and analysis.

2.Date-Time Conversion:
df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'], errors='coerce')
df['Time Out'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time Out'], errors='coerce')
The code converts the 'Time' and 'Time Out' columns to datetime objects. The pd.to_datetime function is used for this purpose. The errors='coerce' parameter is set to handle any conversion errors by replacing them with NaN.

3.Shift Duration Calculation:
df['Shift Duration'] = df['Time Out'] - df['Time']
It calculates the duration of each shift by subtracting the 'Time' from the 'Time Out' column and stores the result in a new column called 'Shift Duration.'

4.a) Print employees who have worked for 7 consecutive days:
consecutive_days = 7
for name, group in df.groupby('Employee Name'):
    consecutive_count = group['Time'].diff().dt.days.eq(1).cumsum()
    if consecutive_count.max() >= consecutive_days - 1:
        print(f"Employee {name} has worked for {consecutive_days} consecutive days.")
This part uses the groupby function to group the DataFrame by 'Employee Name' and then calculates the consecutive days worked using the diff and cumsum functions. If an employee has worked for at least 7 consecutive days, it prints a message.

b) Print employees who have less than 10 hours of time between shifts but greater than 1 hour:
min_hours_between_shifts = 1
max_hours_between_shifts = 10
for name, group in df.groupby('Employee Name'):
    time_between_shifts = group['Time'].diff().dt.total_seconds() / 3600
    mask = (time_between_shifts < max_hours_between_shifts) & (time_between_shifts > min_hours_between_shifts)
    if mask.any():
        print(f"Employee {name} has less than {max_hours_between_shifts} hours but more than {min_hours_between_shifts} hours between shifts.")
This section calculates the time between consecutive shifts and checks if it falls within a specified range. If an employee has less than 10 hours but more than 1 hour between shifts, it prints a message.

c) Print employees who have worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift:
min_hours_single_shift = 14
for name, group in df.groupby('Employee Name'):
    mask = group['Shift Duration'].dt.total_seconds() / 3600 > min_hours_single_shift
    if mask.any():
        print(f"Employee {name} has worked for more than {min_hours_single_shift} hours in a single shift.")
This part checks if an employee has worked for more than 14 hours in a single shift by comparing the 'Shift Duration' column with the specified minimum duration. If true, it prints a message.

The code is using Python and Pandas, which is a powerful data manipulation library, making it easier to analyze and extract insights from tabular data like timecard information. The logic involves grouping the data by employee names and then applying various calculations and conditions to identify specific patterns in the work shifts.
